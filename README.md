## 🎯 Mission

Master Bash scripting through deliberate practice by building two production-ready tools that solve real infrastructure challenges. This repository documents my journey from fundamentals to advanced system programming.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

### Sentinel - System Monitoring Suite
A comprehensive monitoring solution featuring real-time metrics, alerting, and historical analysis.

**Planned Features:** CPU/Memory/Disk monitoring • Custom alerting • Performance graphing • Log analysis

**Status:** 🚧 In Development

[View Sentinel Documentation →](./sentinel/README.md)

### Cerberus - Security Toolkit
An automated security scanner for infrastructure auditing and vulnerability detection.

**Planned Features:** Port scanning • Permission auditing • Security reporting • Compliance checks

**Status:** 🚧 In Development

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

Both tools are built with test-driven development:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for module interactions
- Manual verification scripts for real-world scenarios

Target: 80%+ test coverage by Day 60

## 📚 Learning Resources

Key resources guiding this journey:
- Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide (Mendel Cooper)
- ShellCheck Wiki and best practices
- Linux System Programming documentation
- Real-world open source Bash projects

## 🎯 Success Criteria

By Day 60, I will have:
- ✅ Two fully functional, production-ready tools
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (80%+)
- ✅ Complete technical documentation
- ✅ 60 daily learning logs demonstrating growth
- ✅ Portfolio-ready codebase showcasing skills
